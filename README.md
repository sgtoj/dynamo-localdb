# dynamodb-local

Simple node module that is used to launch and setup a local instance of 
DynamoDB in a development environment. Unlike other NPM dynamodb modules, this
project is more a developer's tool than a simple DynamoDB laucher. As it will
allow those developers, working DynamoDB projects, to quickly setup and reset 
the database.
